# Home-IP-Analyzer
Home IP Analyzer is a basic network monitoring tool. It extracts IPv4 addresses from Wireshark exports, removes local and trusted IPs (Google, Cloudflare, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon), and checks the remaining IPs against VirusTotal using your API key to identify potentially suspicious or malicious connections.
You need your own API code from VirusTotal website. I pasted mine into my_APIS.txt in the resoults to virus total code
