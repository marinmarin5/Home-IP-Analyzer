# Home-IP-Analyzer
Home IP Analyzer is a basic network monitoring tool. It extracts IPv4 addresses from Wireshark exports, removes local and trusted IPs (Google, Cloudflare, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon), and checks the remaining IPs against VirusTotal using your API key to identify potentially suspicious or malicious connections.
